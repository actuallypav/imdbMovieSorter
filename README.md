# imdbMovieSorter
- A simple sorter that reads a text file with lines of movie names
- parses and searches through the imdb database
- returns a formatted html list item, with a link and a year of release
- stores it in another text file


- Mind you the code is a little bit slowwww, it's just a quick solution nothing magic :D
